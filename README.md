# üìà Stock Prediction App

A **Streamlit app** to predict stock prices using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model**.  
The app fetches historical stock data, trains a model, predicts trends, calculates RMSE, and forecasts the next 30 days of stock prices.

---

## Features

- Fetch and visualize historical stock data from Yahoo Finance  
- Train an LSTM model for stock trend prediction  
- Compare predictions with actual stock prices  
- Calculate **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** for test predictions  
- Forecast next 30 days of stock prices  
- Interactive sidebar to select stock ticker, date range, and number of training epochs

venv\Scripts\activate




# Mac/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate




3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt




4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run stock_prediction_app.py
Open the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) in your browser.




5Ô∏è‚É£ Using the App
Enter Stock Ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) in the sidebar

Select Start Date and End Date for historical data

Adjust Training Epochs using the slider

6Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Explore Variables
You can print intermediate variables in Streamlit to understand the data and predictions:





RMSE Explanation
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) measures how far predictions are from actual prices

Smaller RMSE ‚Üí more accurate predictions

Useful for evaluating model performance on test data

Requirements
Python 3.9+
